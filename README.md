# ML-Prediction-for-Orange-Company
# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, machine learning model development, and evaluation to address specific business needs. The project was presented to Orange Company.

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to preprocess and analyze a substantial dataset consisting of over 800,000 records. We applied various machine learning models to gain insights and make predictions based on the data.

### Key Steps and Methodologies

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled a large dataset with over 800,000 records.
   - Cleaned and transformed data to make it suitable for modeling.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implemented and evaluated several machine learning models, including:
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
     - CatBoost
     - XGBoost
     - Logistic Regression

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessed the performance of models using various metrics.
   - Employed cross-validation to ensure the reliability of model performance.
   - Analyzed learning curves and confusion matrices to understand model behavior.

4. **Business Insights:**
   - Extracted actionable insights from model results to inform business decisions.
